# music
This is a very basic PHP script that scans directories and makes uses a media player called Audio.JS .

The concept this will list all artist in your music folder. Then you can click though the artist folder, to the album folder.
when you click into the album folder the JavaScript player will load the album as a play list.

Your file system will need to be setup as follows for this to work.
[site url] / [artist name] / [album name] / [mp3 files]
some of this can be changed via the config.php

used another project called audio.js, found some other script to implement a play list.
